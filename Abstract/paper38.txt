Abstract

Over the past decade, energy demand has witnessed a drastic increase, mainly due to huge development in the industry sector and growing populations. This has led to the global utilization of renewable energy resources and technologies to meet this high demand, as fossil fuels are bound to end and are causing harm to the environment. Solar PV (photovoltaic) systems are a renewable energy technology that allows the utilization of solar energy directly from the sun to meet electricity demands. Solar PV has the potential to create a reliable, clean and stable energy systems for the future. This paper discusses the different types and generations of solar PV technologies available, as well as several important applications of solar PV systems, which are “Large-Scale Solar PV”, “Residential Solar PV”, “Green Hydrogen”, “Water Desalination” and “Transportation”. This paper also provides research on the number of solar papers and their applications that relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the years between 2011 and 2021. A total of 126,513 papers were analyzed. The results show that 72% of these papers are within SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. This shows that there is a lack of research in solar energy regarding the SDGs, especially SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 10: Reduced Inequality and SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. More research is needed in these fields to create a sustainable world with solar PV technologies.
