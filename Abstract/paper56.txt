Abstract
Governments worldwide have prioritized carbon reduction and neutrality to address the escalating threat of climate change. These goals are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG-13). These goals stress taking action on climate change to lessen the bad effects of human activities and using fossil fuels for energy. To this end, the present study investigates the connection between conventional energy usage, agricultural practices, economic growth, and their impact on environmental sustainability in South Africa. Additionally, it explores the role of renewable energy consumption and environmental technological innovation in mitigating these effects. To achieve the study objectives, a carbon-income function is fitted with an annual frequency data from 1975 to 2020. The present study leverages on Pesaran's Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and for robustness analysis the dynamic ARDL simulations method to simultaneously explore the short and long-run coefficients of the study's outlined variables. Empirical analysis, confirmed by bounds testing for cointegration, reveals a long-term equilibrium relationship among the variables considered. Notably, economic growth, fossil fuel energy consumption, and agricultural activities have adverse effects on environmental sustainability in South Africa, indicating a trade-off between economic growth and environmental quality. Dynamic ARDL simulations provide further evidence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) phenomenon. However, renewable energy consumption and environmental technological innovation positively influence environmental quality. These findings highlight the imperative for South Africa and its stakeholders to adopt green growth policies and transition to cleaner energy alternatives.
