Abstract
Rising concerns about the dependence of modern energy systems on fossil fuels have raised the requirement for green alternate fuels to pave the roadmap for a sustainable energy future with a carbon-free economy. Massive expectations of hydrogen as an enabler for decarbonization of the energy sector are limited by the lack of required infrastructure, whose implementation is affected by the issues related to the storage and distribution of hydrogen energy. Ammonia is an effective hydrogen energy carrier with a well-established and mature infrastructure for long-distance transportation and distribution. The possibility for green ammonia production from renewable energy sources has made it a suitable green alternate fuel for the decarbonization of the automotive and power generation sectors. In this work, engine characteristics for ammonia combustion in spark ignition engines have been reported with a detailed note on engines fuelled with pure ammonia as well as blends of ammonia with gasoline, hydrogen, and methane. Higher auto-ignition temperature, low flammability, and lower flame speed of ammonia have a detrimental effect on engine characteristics, and it could be addressed either by incorporating engine modifications or by enhancing the fuel quality. Literature shows that the increase in compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 11.5:1 improved the maximum power by 59% and the addition of 10% hydrogen in supercharged conditions improved the indicated efficiency by 37%. Challenges and strategies for the utilization of ammonia as combustible fuel in engines are discussed by considering the need for technical advancements as well as social acceptance. Energy efficiency for green ammonia production is also discussed with a due note on techniques for direct synthesis of ammonia from air and water.
