Abstract
Nuclear reactors and variable renewables will play a significant role in the global energy transition as providers of low carbon electricity to various end use sectors. Real time balancing of power demand and supply without modulation or curtailment is possible using electrolytic hydrogen plants and energy storage systems. The generation mix adopted and load profiles are unique to a country and this study considers the specific case of India. This work analyses the use of grid connected water electrolysers, grid scale battery storage, hydrogen storage and fuel cells as flexible loads and dispatch schemes for grid balancing. Based on postulated long term power generation scenarios for India, the minimum required system sizes for grid balancing are estimated and techno-economic uncertainties are assessed. The use of water electrolysers is prioritized to make use of excess power, while minimizing battery storage requirement. This scheme can potentially produce a substantial share of low carbon hydrogen in India for use in industrial decarbonization, thus reducing the need for additional generation infrastructure.
