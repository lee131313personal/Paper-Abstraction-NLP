Green nanotechnology is an emerging field of science that focuses on the production of nanoparticles by living cells through biological pathways. This topic plays an extremely imperative responsibility in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, nuclear energy, fuel and energy, electronics, and bioengineering. Biological processes by green synthesis tools are more suitable to develop nanoparticles ranging from 1 to 100 nm compared to other related methods, owing to their safety, eco-friendliness, non-toxicity, and cost-effectiveness. In particular, the metal nanoparticles are synthesized by top-down and bottom-up approaches through various techniques like physical, chemical, and biological methods. Their characterization is very vital and the confirmation of nanoparticle traits is done by various instrumentation analyses such as UV–Vis spectrophotometry (UV–Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), and intracranial pressure (ICP). In this review, we provide especially information on green synthesized metal nanoparticles, which are helpful to improve biomedical and environmental applications. In particular, the methods and conditions of plant-based synthesis, characterization techniques, and applications of green silver, gold, iron, selenium, and copper nanoparticles are overviewed.
