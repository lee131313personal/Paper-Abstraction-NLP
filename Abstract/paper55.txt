Among the carbon nanomaterials family, the fluorescent carbon dot has emerged as a significant member among the novel types of nanomaterials, and many researchers have introduced studies on its properties and potential applications. Carbon dots (CDs) have numerous outstanding characteristics, such as remarkable photostability, negligible cytotoxicity, exceptional biocompatibility, effortless surface modification, and remarkable chemical inertness. As a result, they have found extensive applications in various domains, including but not limited to cell imaging, in vivo imaging, drug delivery, fluorescence sensing, photocatalysis, production of polychromatic light emitting diodes (LEDs), energy conversion and storage, etc. Recently, many synthesis strategies of carbon dots have been developed, but how to synthesize in a controlled way is still challenging. The focus of this article is to provide an overview of the advancements made in the production of carbon dots, with particular attention given to their synthesis techniques along with some discussion and provide a reference for the controllable synthesis and method selection of carbon dots.
