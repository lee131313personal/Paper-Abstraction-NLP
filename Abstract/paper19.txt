Abstract

Australia is one of the leading countries in energy transition, and its largest power system is intended to securely operate with up to 75% of variable renewable generation by 2025. High-inertia synchronous condensers, battery energy storage systems, and grid-forming converters are some of the technologies supporting this transformation while facilitating the secure operation of the grid. Synchronous condensers have enabled 2500 MW of solar and wind generation in the state of South Australia, reaching minimum operational demands of â‰ˆ100 MW. Grid-scale battery energy storage systems have demonstrated not only market benefits by cutting costs to consumers but also essential grid services during contingencies. Fast frequency response, synthetic inertia, and high fault currents are some of the grid-supporting capabilities provided by new developments that strengthen the grid while facilitating the integration of new renewable energy hubs. This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview, based on the Australian experience, of how power systems are overcoming expected challenges while continuing to integrate secure, low cost, and clean energy.
