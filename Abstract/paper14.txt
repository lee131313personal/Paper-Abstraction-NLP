Zinc alkaline anodes command significant share of consumer battery markets and are a key technology for the emerging grid-scale battery market. Improved understanding of this electrode is required for long-cycle deployments at kWh and MWh scale due to strict requirements on performance, cost, and safety. Here we give a modern literature survey of zinc alkaline anodes with levelized performance metrics and also present an experimental assessment of leading formulations. Long-cycle materials characterization, performance metrics, and failure analysis are reported for over 25 unique anode formulations with up to 1500 cycles and ∼1.5 years of shelf life per test. Statistical repeatability of these measurements is made for a baseline design (fewest additives) via 15 duplicates. Baseline design capacity density is 38 mAh per mL of anode volume, and lifetime throughput is 72 Ah per mL of anode volume. We then report identical measurements for anodes with improved material properties via additives and other perturbations, some of which achieve capacity density over 192 mAh per mL of anode volume and lifetime throughput of 190 Ah per mL of anode volume. Novel in operando X-ray microscopy of a cycling zinc paste anode reveals the formation of a nanoscale zinc material that cycles electrochemically and replaces the original anode structure over long-cycle life. Ex situ elemental mapping and other materials characterization suggest that the key physical processes are hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), growth of zinc oxide nanoscale material, concentration deficits of OH– and ZnOH42–, and electrodeposition of Zn growths outside and through separator membranes.
