Abstract
The ever-increasing energy demand, depleting fossil fuel reserves, and rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions have necessitated the transition towards the generation of green and clean energy through renewable energy sources. Solar energy is one such renewable energy source that has received significant attention owing to its abundance and inexhaustibility. However, solar energy alone cannot replace fossil fuels in the energy portfolio. There exists a need to develop another clean energy source that can potentially act as an alternative to conventional fuels. Hydrogen proves to be an ideal candidate in this domain and can be sustainably generated by water electrolysis by powering the electrolyzer using solar energy. The hydrogen thus synthesized has net zero carbon emissions and is a suitable asset for decarbonizing the environment. This review encompasses the generation of hydrogen using PV-Electrolyzer systems and addresses the challenges associated with the same. Overcoming these drawbacks can ensure a strong position for hydrogen as an alternative fuel in the energy infrastructure. By employing electrolyzers that are fueled by renewable energy and then using that hydrogen to feed a fuel cell, this study aims to clarify the potential and constraints of producing green hydrogen. Since this area of research has not yet been fully investigated, a review article that enables and encourages academics to develop original solutions is urgently needed.
