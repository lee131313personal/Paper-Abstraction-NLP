# Paper-Abstraction-NLP

## Introduction about the project 
This project aims to develop a script that clusters a given set of research papers based on their abstract similarity.

## Key words:
Natural Language processing, Text processing, Unsupervised machine learning. 

## Set up the environment
All the dependencies and library needs to be prepared. I recommend take advantage of virtual environment. 
One example for creating the virtual environment is using "virtualenv".

# Virtual Env
Active the bash environment and run the following command:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Dependencies and Libraries
